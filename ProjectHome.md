This is a small project I made in college. It's an android-based remote control for the LEGO Mindstorms NXT Series. You connect via Bluetooth and control with the position of your phone/tablet using the gyroscope. You also can record your movements and create a macro which you can play again anytime.

This project is not being continued, feel free to improve it further!
